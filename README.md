### 📅 **Full Stack Developer Intern – ITA Moulay Rachid**

### 🏆 **Hackathon Enthusiast & Volunteer**
While interning, I didn’t stop there—I participated in a **development hackathon** 🥇, which was a thrilling experience of competition and teamwork. I also gave back by volunteering to install an operating system on over **200 devices** 💻 at one of the ISTA centers for the OFPPT.

After my internship, I took on the challenge of leading the **backend development** of a project aimed at solving scheduling issues for ISTA Ben M'sik. It was an awesome experience that sharpened my problem-solving skills!
